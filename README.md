## pPb 8TeV 2017 Dijet Analyses ##
Subdirectory allocated towards dijet analyses in the 2016 8.16TeV proton-lead run. This includes two main subdirectories: jet analyses, which runs over the data given a trigger configuration, and trigger analyses, which runs over the triggers and creates a configuration.

## pp 5TeV 2017 Offline Electron Analyses ##
This subdirectory is allocated for offline electron performance analyses in the 2017 5.02TeV proton-proton run. At this point, the subproject is largely finished due to the end of the run. However the code found here may be useful in future offline performance studies.

## pPb 8TeV 2016 Jet Calibration ##
This subdirectory contains code and output from my ATLAS qualification task, which is primarily to perform a jet calibration on pPb 8TeV MC15 data.
