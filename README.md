##P Pb Dijet Analyses
Subdirectory allocated towards dijet analyses in the 2016 8.16TeV proton-lead run. This includes two main subdirectories: jet analyses, which runs over the data given a trigger configuration, and trigger analyses, which runs over the triggers and creates a configuration.

##Offline Analyses
This subdirectory is allocated for offline electron performance analyses in the 2017 5.02TeV proton-proton run. At this point, the subproject is largely finished due to the end of the run. However the code found here may be useful in future offline performance studies.
