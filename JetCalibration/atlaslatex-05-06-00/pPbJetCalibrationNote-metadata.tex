\AtlasAbstract{%
A calibration procedure for HI jets in 2016 \textit{p}+Pb collisions at \SI{8.16}{\TeV} is established and tested. Numerical inversion is performed on reconstructed and truth jets in MC to obtain the jet energy scale (EtaJES) corrections. The calibration summary plots are presented and a procedure for applying the calibration is shown, with intended use for the 2016 \SI{8.16}{\TeV} \textit{p}+Pb data. Applicability of the \textit{in situ}-based cross-calibration between EMTopo and HI jets in 2015 \SI{5.02}{\TeV} \textit{pp} collisions to the 2016 \textit{p}+Pb data is also tested by studying the $\pt$ balance in vector boson + jet events in data and MC. Deviations in the cross-calibration between data and MC are found to be subdominant to known jet systematic uncertainties, implying that the 2015 cross-calibration is applicable to the 2016 \textit{p}+Pb data.
