\AtlasAbstract{%
Numerical inversion is performed on reconstructed and truth jets in MC to obtain the eta jet energy scale (EtaJES) corrections in 2016 proton-lead collisions at \SI{8.16}{\TeV}. The calibration summary plots are presented and a procedure for applying the calibration is shown, with intended use for the 2016 \SI{8.16}{\TeV} \textit{p}+Pb data. Applicability of the \textit{in situ}-based cross-calibration between EMTopo and HI jets in 2015 \SI{5.02}{\TeV} \textit{pp} collisions to the 2016 \textit{p}+Pb data is also tested by studying the $p_{\text{T}}$ balance in vector boson + jet events in data and MC as well as by studying tracks inside the jet cone. Deviations in the cross-calibration between data and MC are found to be subdominant to other sources of jet systematic uncertainties, implying that the cross-calibration is applicable to the 2016 \textit{p}+Pb data.
